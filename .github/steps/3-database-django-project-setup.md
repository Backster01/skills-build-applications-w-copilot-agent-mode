## Step 3: Initialize and create the tutoring-sa_db MongoDB database, Django project/app, update Django project/app files, and populate the MongoDB database

In this step, we will accomplish the following:

- Set up the tutoring-sa_db MongoDB database structure.
- Update the tutoring-sa/backend/tutoring-sa app files:
  - settings, models, serializers, urls, views, tests, and admin files.
- Populate the tutoring-sa_db database with test data.
- Verify the test data is populated in the tutoring-sa_db database.

1. Open all files in the `docs` folder and keep this file open in the editor throughout this exercise.
    1.  agent mode uses `tutor-sa.md` and `tutor-sa_story.md` as a reference to create the application
2. Copy and paste the following prompt(s) in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> ü™ß **Note:** 
- Do not change the model from GPT-4o this will be an optional activity at the end of the course.
- Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational so it may ask you questions and you can ask it questions too.
- Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
- Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
- Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your code base and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your code base and automatically self heal if it or you makes a mistake in the process.

> ü™ß **Note:** 
- Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute each command presented by Copilot agent mode.
- Keep files created and updated until the Copilot agent mode has finished.

>
> 1. Initialize the mongo tutoring-sa_db database.
> 2. Create a correct table structure for users, Dashboard interfaces, CAPS curriculum structure, assesments, and assessment reports.
> 3. Make sure there is a unique ID for the primary key for the user collection.
>   ex. db.users.createIndex({ "email": 1 }, { unique: true })
> 4. Execute the command for me to create the database.
> 5. List the collections in the tutoring-sa_db database.

- If there is no "Continue" button, just pull the left side of the GitHub Copilot Chat panel over to the left, and it should appear.
- If this doesn't work, you may need to copy and paste the response in the terminal if there is no "Continue" button.
